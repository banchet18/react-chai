1) index.html is main file where all content is loaded.
2) noscript tag -> if suppose in browser javascript is not available then noscript tag shows What you write eg.you need to enable javascript to run this app.

3) react-dom is important virtual dom it is used for web browsers 

4) jsx -> <App/> , <chetan/> => custom tag

5) react-script is used to connect index.html to index.js which is located in package.json file.

6) vite do not use react-script its used script tag.

7) to create component uppercase is must -> good practice.

8) by the component we can only return a single element. good practice is wrap all elements in single div or fragment.
